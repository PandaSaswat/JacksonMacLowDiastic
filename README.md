This uses a seed word to select words from a source text to make poetry, using an algorithm. 
The algorithm uses the seed word to find words which fit a certain pattern. 
The order of characters in the seed word are used to find words which have that character in that same location.

Example: 

  seed word: saswat
  
  sample output: <b>S</b>eptember W<b>a</b>r wa<b>s</b> kno<b>w</b>n prim<b>a</b>rily muske<b>t</b>s, (using words from a random page on wikipedia, here it is the civil war article.)
  
So First word that with first letter S, Second word with second letter A, Third word with  third letter S, etc.


Will edit later to use random wiki page instead of default text.
